## Intro

Yet another COVID-19 dashboard

## Description

Yet another COVID-19 dashboard built by yet another data science enthusiast.  
I made this so I can look at the data the way I like, and also because I wanted to learn Pandas and Dash to have other options besides Shiny and Tidyverse.  
Please feel free to fork, modify and distribute.

## About the slider

The slider only works when date is not set on the X axis. If anything else is set on the X axis, the slider parses dates.

## To do

- Merge with countries census data
- Use ipython widgets to build dashboard within jupyter notebook
